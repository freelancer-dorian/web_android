<p>The HTML viewportmeta tag was introduced by Apple for use in Mobile Safari on the 
iPhone, and is used to tell the mobile browser exactly whatit is seeing. Without a 
viewportmeta tag, the browser will assume it islooking at a web page that is built for 
desktop browsing and thus scale the display down to fit. An example viewportmeta tag 
definition is as follows: 
In this particular instance, we are telling the browser that we wish to have the page 
displayed at the screen width ofthe device, and that the usershould not be permitted to 
zoom in and out on the viewport. Zooming in and out on the display is generally pretty 
handy when looking at a sitethat hasn’t been optimized for mobile; however, when 
viewing a mobile-ready page, it’s not generally required, and can sometimes be a 
hindrance to other functionality that you want to offer in your app. </p>
